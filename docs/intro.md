Radicle Registry is an account-based blockchain protocol that acts as a canonical global registry for code repositories. It provides users with the trusted, auditable and shared view of the network. It introduces a complementary and foremost secure layer to the [Radicle P2P](https://radicle.xyz/) network.

The full node daemon, `TBD` is written in Rust and based on [substrate](https://substrate.dev/). By running a full node, you can participate in securing the network and serving canonical registry keys for Radicle.

## Tokens

The integrity of our canonical registry is secured through an incentivized [proof-of-work (PoW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) based consensus scheme. The Registry uses a utility token to support its native functions such as project registration, checkpointing etc. (`TBD` better explanation).

We strive to achieve network ownership by the [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foss) community from [genesis](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block).
