title: Why Radicle?

Throughout the last decade, open source has become a standard for software development. Sharing code freely and publicly has made it drastically cheaper and easier to build software—and tech innovation is surging as a result.

Code hosting and collaboration platforms like GitHub and GitLab have contributed heavily to the growth of open source by bringing it to a mainstream audience. They defined standard vocabulary and behaviors, made git accessible to a greater audience, empowered social coding, and created global communities of developers. It is an undeniable fact that they have completely changed the way people write code.

As the status quo for code collaboration, these platforms also host the largest repositories of open source development made up of not just code, but issues, pull requests, reviews, and comments. Even the social relationships—stars, likes, follows—exist solely within these platforms.

These platforms, however, are owned by corporations. They are subject to corporate law and have the right to define their terms of services. They can implement [user bans](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/)—like those currently in place against Iranian, Syrian, and Crimean GitHub accounts in response to pressure from the U.S. government. They are vulnerable to [censorship](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/github-removes-tsunami-democratics-apk-after-a-takedown-order-from-spain/) as well as capitalist ends, which are often misaligned with the goals of free and open source communities.

In a world where [nearly all software relies on open source code](https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/2976/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure.pdf), maintaining the resilience and health of the free and open source ecosystem is more important than ever. That's why we believe that dependence on centrally hosted platforms and corporations for the distribution of critical open source infrastructure is unsustainable. Reliance on such centralized services contradicts the values of the free and open source ecosystem and threatens its well-being.

Radicle was conceived as an alternative. Its goal is to eliminate intermediaries and create a peer-to-peer ecosystem that is robust, functional, and secure. There must be an intentional shift in narrative to prioritize the adoption of decentralized alternatives for code collaboration that abide by the principles of free and open source software.

> At the core of the open source ethos is the idea of liberty. Open source is about inverting power structures and creating access and opportunities for everyone.
