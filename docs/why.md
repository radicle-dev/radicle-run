title: Why Radicle?
---

We live in a time when the original promise of the internet has failed us. Our online activity is owned by a few large corporations, and a large part of open-source collaboration is locked in for-profit products. What used to be an open and decentralized process is now controlled by a few major players. The reason is that FOSS is no longer just about the code — it’s about much more today, including distribution, hosting, collaboration and financing, and these requirements were only able to be met by centralized for-profit organizations.

In a world where nearly all software relies on open source code, maintaining the resilience and health of the free and open source ecosystem is more important than ever. That's why we believe that dependence on centrally hosted platforms and corporations for the distribution of critical open source infrastructure is unsustainable. Reliance on such centralized services contradicts the values of the free and open source ecosystem and threatens its well-being.

Radicle was conceived as an alternative. Its goal is to eliminate intermediaries and create a sovereign, peer-to-peer ecosystem, that is secure and sustainable.

"At the core of the open source ethos is the idea of liberty. Open source is about inverting power structures and creating access and opportunities for everyone." — GitHub employees' letter to GitHub
