The Radicle Network aka. the Registry is the canonical source for all project and user metadata, including identity. It is a decentralized service which provides trustless read and write access to this data.

The Registry maintains a global, immutable and always available identity service for organizations and users in a decentralized manner. Its a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) network.

We designed the registry as a permissionless blockchain using Nakamoto consensus and proof-of-work. We chose Nakamoto consensus for its operational simplicity, and proof-of-work for its best-in-class support for light clients.

The user is not directly exposed to the registry, but uses the registry's services through end-user applications. The user is able to register orgs and user handles, as well as manage funds held by the registry.

The registry enables all users to have a wallet that is linked to their code collaboration identity. It enables orgs to have a wallet and manage funds linked to projects, and it allows users and orgs to benefit from a sovereign identity.

It also enables native value transfer, ie. transfer of money and native assets between users. This allows developers to monetize their work or services offered on the network, with little to no friction.
